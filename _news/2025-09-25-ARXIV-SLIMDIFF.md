Our latest work, [SlimDiff](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.21498){:target="\_blank} on ***training-free, activation-guided hands-free slimming of diffusion models***, is now available on arXiv! In this paper, we propose the first closed-form, diffusion trajectory-aware structural compression of Stable Diffusion Models that is entirely training-free! 🎉
