Super excited to announce I'll be joining ***Amazon Kumo, AWS*** in Bellevue, WA, as an ***Applied Science Intern***!

I'll be working with [Radhika Bhargava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bR2wtS4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="\_blank}, [Anwesan Pal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=b3g7914AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="\_blank} and [Yue Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8VO6LmwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="\_blank}, focusing on a very exciting challenge: developing continual learning algorithms for large language models. We'll be researching strategies using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to allow for scalable lifelong adaptation using regularized low-rank adapter updates via cross-task subspace decorrelation.

I'm incredibly excited to get started on this research, which will form the basis of the ***ELLA*** project. 🎉
