Our new work on efficient video understanding is now available on arXiv! The paper, [Learning Unified Spatio-temporal Representations for Efficient Compressed Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13724){:target="\_blank}, proposes a lightweight framework that learning video representations directly from compressed videos. This avoids the need for decompression and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 15x faster inference! 🎉
