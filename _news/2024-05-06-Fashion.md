Thrilled to announce I'm joining ***Amazon Fashion*** in Sunnyvale as an ***Applied Science Intern***!

I'll be working with [Prateek Singhal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sqU8ApgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="\_blank} and [Matthew Shreve](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q7xWNk4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="\_blank} on a super exciting challenge: designing new diffusion-model-based tools for image editing. We're hoping to find ways to give users granular, pixel-level control and allow them to draw inspiration from multiple reference images to create their perfect custom image using off-the-shelf image diffusion models.

This problem is the exact inspiration for ***PIXELS***, a project I'm passionate about, and I can't wait to dive in and start building! 🎉
