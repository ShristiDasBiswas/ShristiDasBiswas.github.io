I'm happy to share that our paper, ***HALSIE: Hybrid Approach to Learning Segmentation by Simultaneously Exploiting Image and Event Modalities***, was accepted to the [ICCV 2023 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/wicviccv2023/home){:target="\_blank}! 🎉 

I had a great time presenting this work, which shows how a hybrid SNN+ANN approach can achieve highly efficient multi-modal learning.
