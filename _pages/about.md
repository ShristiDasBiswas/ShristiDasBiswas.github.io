I am a Ph.D. researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Purdue University**, advised by **Prof. Kaushik Roy** (NRL). My research develops **safe, controllable, and efficient foundation models**, spanning:

- **Concept unlearning & safety in generative models** – removing harmful/unwanted concepts without retraining. 
- **Generative model efficiency** – training-free inference acceleration and dynamic compression. 
- **Continual Adaptation of generative models** – scalable lifelong learning in LLMs. - **Compressed video understanding** – compute-efficient dual-stream architectures for efficient video processing. 
- **Controllable and creative content creation** – inference-time exemplar-based image editing without retraining for the refererence image-following objective.

My work is motivated by the intersection of **trustworthy AI**, **efficient generative modeling**, **continual capability improvement**, and **foundation model alignment**. I focus on building **training-free mathematical frameworks** that require **no finetuning, no additional data, and no architectural changes**. Previously, I worked as an **Applied Science Intern at Amazon AWS and Amazon Fashion** working on adaptive multi-agent LLM routing, and creative imagery generation for producing lifestyle content. 

I have also served as a peer reviewer for **NeurIPS, ICCV, CVPR, ICLR, AAAI, WACV**, and **AAAI**, where I serve in the **Program Committee**. --- ### Research Interests **Diffusion models · Model editing · Concept unlearning · Trustworthy ML · Generative compression · Continual learning · Efficient foundation models**
