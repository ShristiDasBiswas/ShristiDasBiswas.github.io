I am a Ph.D. researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Purdue University**, advised by **Prof. Kaushik Roy** (NRL). My research develops **safe, controllable, and efficient foundation models**, spanning:

- **Concept Unlearning & Safety in Generative Models** – removing harmful/unwanted concepts without retraining. 
- **Generative Model Efficiency** – training-free inference acceleration and dynamic compression of diffusion models. 
- **Continual Adaptation of Language Models** – scalable lifelong learning in LLMs. 
- **Efficient Video Understanding** – compute-efficient dual-stream architectures for efficient video processing using spiking neural streams. 
- **Controllable and Creative Content Creation** – inference-time exemplar-based image editing without retraining for the refererence image-following objective.

My work is motivated by the intersection of **Trustworthy AI**, **Efficient Generative Modeling**, **Continual Capability Improvement**, and **Foundation Model Alignment**. I focus on building **training-free mathematical frameworks** that enumerate and help understand knowledge inside generative image and language models.

Previously, I worked as an **Applied Science Intern** at <span class="accent">**Amazon AWS**</span> and <span class="accent">**Amazon Fashion**</span>, working on Adaptive Multi-agent LLM Routing, and Creative Diffusion-Based Imagery Generation for Producing Lifestyle Content. 

I have served as a peer reviewer for **NeurIPS, ICCV, CVPR, ICLR, AAAI, WACV**, and **AAAI**, where I also serve in the **Program Committee**.
