My work is motivated by the intersection of **trustworthy AI**, **efficient generative modeling**, **continual capability improvement**, and **foundation model alignment**. I focus on building **training-free mathematical frameworks** that require **no finetuning, no additional data, and no architectural changes**. This site provides a comprehensive overview of my work, including publications, research projects, and professional news. Additionally, the blog serves as a platform for commentary and discussion on developments in efficient and responsible generative AI, computer vision, and related applications.</subtitle></feed>
